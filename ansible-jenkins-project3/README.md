# 🚀 Jenkins + Ansible Roles: Automating Web Server Deployment

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Jenkins** with **Ansible** to automate infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using **Ansible roles**.

The pipeline is designed to:
- Clone a GitHub repository using Jenkins
- Run an Ansible playbook via Jenkins
- Use Ansible roles to install **NGINX** and deploy a simple **HTML page** to a remote web server

> ✅ This is not just a static website project — it's a CI/CD automation project focused on running **Ansible automation from Jenkins**.

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Jenkins** – Continuous Integration/Deployment orchestrator
- **Ansible** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation tool
- **NGINX** – Web server to serve static content
- **Git/GitHub** – Source code repository

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Jenkins fetches this repository.
2. Jenkins executes the `ansible-playbook` command using the `deploy.yml` file.
3. The playbook uses the `app` role to:
   - Install NGINX on the remote server.
   - Copy a static HTML file to `/var/www/html/`.
   - Restart the NGINX service.

## 🧱 Ansible Role Tasks (main.yml)

```yaml
- name: Install NGINX
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Copy HTML file
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    owner: www-data
    group: www-data
    mode: '0644'

- name: Restart NGINX
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
    enabled: true
```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### On Jenkins Server:

* Jenkins installed and configured
* Ansible installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y
  ```
* SSH key pair generated by Jenkins:

  ```bash
  sudo su jenkins
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/ansible_key
  ```
* Public key copied to remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Pipeline

1. Clone this project to GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git
```

2. Set up a **Jenkins Pipeline job**:

   * SCM: Git
   * Script Path: `Jenkinsfile`

3. Click **"Build Now"**

4. Access the deployed site at:

   ```
   http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>
   ```
